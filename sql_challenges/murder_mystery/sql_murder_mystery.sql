        I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. 
        The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
        Only gold members have those bags. 
        The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

        I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.
